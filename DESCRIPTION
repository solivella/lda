Description: Implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
	     and related models.  This includes (but is not limited
	     to) sLDA, corrLDA, and the mixed-membership stochastic
	     blockmodel.  Inference for all of these models is
	     implemented via a fast collapsed Gibbs sampler written
	     in C.  Utility functions for reading/writing data
	     typically used in topic models, as well as tools for
	     examining posterior distributions are also included.
